TEST Howto~
--| Command to run test
    cd /patch/to/project/test
    make
    make run

--| Result
You could see "Successfully" or "Error" from output. "Error" messages always attach the line number where the issue raises.

--| Add test
Test case can be added just like "t1.c". Both modifying "t1.c" and adding a new test file (need to modify Makefile) are workable.
